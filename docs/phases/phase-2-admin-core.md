# Phase 2: Admin Core Implementation

**Goal**: Admin can upload and manage audiobooks with AI processing pipeline  
**Timeline**: Day 2 (6-8 hours)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Dashboard, Upload & Full CRUD Operations Complete

## Prerequisites

✅ **From Phase 1**:
- Authentication system with role-based access
- Database schema deployed (9 tables)
- Supabase Storage configured
- shadcn/ui components installed
- Middleware for route protection

## Core Features

### 1. Admin Dashboard ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-02)
- ✅ Statistics cards (total audiobooks, processing status, storage usage)
- ✅ Recent uploads and processing activity
- ✅ System health indicators  
- ✅ Quick action buttons
- ✅ Real-time data integration with 30-second refresh
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design with professional UI
- ✅ Database permissions fixed (RLS + schema USAGE grants)
- ✅ Admin role-based navigation working
- ✅ All console errors resolved (404s and TypeErrors)

### 2. Upload System ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-02)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop interface with progress tracking
- ✅ File validation (MP3, M4A, M4B, AAC formats, max 500MB)
- ✅ Direct-to-storage uploads using Supabase presigned URLs
- ✅ Metadata collection form (title, author, price, cover image)
- ✅ Presigned URL generation with secure authentication
- ✅ Upload completion handling and database integration
- ✅ Professional UI with error handling and user feedback

### 3. Audiobook Management ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-02)
- ✅ Data table with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- ✅ Full CRUD operations - Create via upload, Read, Update, Delete completed
- ✅ Status management (draft, processing, active, inactive)
- ✅ Edit modal with comprehensive form validation
- ✅ Delete operations (soft delete and permanent delete)
- ❌ Bulk operations support (deferred to future enhancement)

## Technical Architecture

### Upload Strategy
- **Direct Upload**: Browser → Supabase Storage (bypasses server)
- **Presigned URLs**: Generated server-side with temporary access
- **File Chunking**: For large files to handle network interruptions
- **Processing Trigger**: File upload completion triggers AI processing job

### Data Flow
1. Admin uploads file → Direct to Supabase Storage
2. File upload completion → Create audiobook record (status: processing)
3. Database trigger → Queue AI processing job (Phase 3)
4. Processing completion → Update audiobook status to active
