- **Solution**: Event-driven architecture with Inngest
- **Features**: Progress tracking, retry logic, error recovery
- **Output**: Real-time status updates in admin dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Event-Driven Processing Flow

```
1. File Upload Complete (Phase 2) 
   â†“
2. Trigger Inngest Event: 'audiobook/uploaded'
   â†“  
3. Background Worker Processes:
   â€¢ Download audio from Supabase Storage
   â€¢ Chunk file if > 25MB
   â€¢ Send chunks to Whisper API
   â€¢ Merge transcription results
   â€¢ Generate summary with GPT-4
   â€¢ Extract categories
   â€¢ Update database records
   â†“
4. Update audiobook status: 'processing' â†’ 'active'
   â†“
5. Admin dashboard shows completion
```

## API Endpoints

### New Processing Endpoints

```typescript
// Job Management
POST   /api/admin/jobs/create          // Trigger processing job
GET    /api/admin/jobs                 // List all processing jobs  
GET    /api/admin/jobs/[id]            // Get specific job details
POST   /api/admin/jobs/[id]/retry      // Retry failed job
DELETE /api/admin/jobs/[id]/cancel     // Cancel running job

// Inngest Integration
POST   /api/inngest                    // Inngest webhook handler

// Processing Results
GET    /api/admin/transcriptions/[id]  // Get transcription results
PUT    /api/admin/transcriptions/[id]  // Update transcription
GET    /api/admin/processing/stats     // Processing statistics
```

### Enhanced Admin Endpoints

```typescript
// Extended audiobook endpoints
GET    /api/admin/audiobooks           // Include processing status
PUT    /api/admin/audiobooks/[id]      // Update with AI-generated content
POST   /api/admin/audiobooks/[id]/regenerate // Re-run AI processing
```

## Database Updates

### Processing Jobs Table Usage

The `processing_jobs` table from Phase 1 schema will store:

```sql
-- Example job record lifecycle
INSERT INTO processing_jobs (
  audiobook_id,
  job_type,
  status,
  progress,
  metadata
) VALUES (
  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  'transcription',
  'processing',
  45,
  '{"chunks_total": 4, "chunks_completed": 2}'
);
```

### Transcriptions Table Usage

Store transcription results:

```sql  
-- Example transcription record
INSERT INTO transcriptions (
  audiobook_id,
  full_text,
  word_count,
  confidence_score,
  processing_time_ms
) VALUES (
  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  'Chapter 1: The Beginning...',
  15420,
  0.94,
  12500
);
```

## Configuration Files

### 1. Inngest Configuration

Create `inngest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "audiobook-platform",
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "Process Audiobook",
      "path": "/api/inngest"
    }
  ],
  "retries": {
    "default": 3
  },
  "concurrency": 5
}
```

### 2. OpenAI Configuration

Environment-based configuration:
- Development: Lower rate limits, test prompts
- Production: Full rate limits, optimized prompts
- Staging: Middle ground for testing

### 3. FFmpeg Configuration

Ensure FFmpeg is available:
- Local development: Install via package manager
- Railway deployment: Include in Docker image
- Configuration for optimal audio processing

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. Error Categories

| Error Type | Recovery Strategy | User Impact |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| **API Rate Limit** | Exponential backoff, queue | Delayed processing |
| **File Too Large** | Chunking strategy | Automatic handling |
| **Invalid Audio** | Format conversion | User notification |
| **Network Timeout** | Retry with backoff | Transparent retry |
| **OpenAI Quota** | Queue until reset | Admin notification |
| **Processing Failure** | Manual intervention | Admin review |

### 2. Retry Logic

```typescript
interface RetryConfig {
  maxAttempts: 3
  backoffMultiplier: 2
  initialDelay: 1000
  maxDelay: 30000
}
```

### 3. Fallback Strategies

- **Whisper API Down**: Queue for later processing
- **GPT-4 API Down**: Skip content generation, allow manual
- **Worker Down**: Queue jobs for when service returns
- **Storage Issues**: Retry with different download strategy
