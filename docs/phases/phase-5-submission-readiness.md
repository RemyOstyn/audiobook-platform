## Notes

This project demonstrates production-ready architecture with:
- Type-safe database operations (Prisma)
- Reliable background job processing (Inngest)  
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Scalable file processing for large audiobooks
- Real-time processing status updates
- Role-based security with RLS

The remaining work focuses on testing, documentation, and presentation rather than core functionality implementation.
